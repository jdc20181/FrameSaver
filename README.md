# FrameSaver

**Announcments**

**Version 0.1.0 Beta Release Date**

I am going to be launching FrameSaver sometime in July - Currently I am still working on it. 

The releaase will include basic saving to Disk, and later in another release I will add Uploading support to something like imigur.



# About 
Frame Saver is a VB.NET Developed Screenshot program - What makes this one different from the rest is the fact it is MIT Licensed. Open-Source projects like this one are pretty rare. And the ones you do find tend to be abandonded after a short time. 

You may know this feature or notice it, from another project of mine, BeffsBrowser, which is a Browser with so many features I can't even begin to tell you about it. 


**Current Plans**

- Basic Version (Beta) will be released soon. 

- The next version after the first launch will have a better design, and more features. 

- Launch Development DLL Version (With PAID Support) 

**Future Plans**

- Upload Support using Imgur API or something similar
