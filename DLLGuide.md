Building from the source vs using the DLL makes things different, first of all, the DLL has been built to run smoother and is lighter so you can make a nice application without using a lot of space. 

To work with the DLL you need to download the latest release, the DLL is automatically included with updates, just look in the DEV Folder. After Beta - I may reevaluate and release it as a seperate zip. 

The DLL includes all that is required to make it work, there is a little configuring to do. 

**Work in progress**
